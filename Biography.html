    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <h1>Early life</h1>
    <p>
        

        Haile Selassie's royal line (through his father's mother) descended from the Shewan Amhara Solomonic King,
        Sahle Selassie. He was born on 23 July 1892, in the village of Ejersa Goro, in the Harar province of
         Ethiopia. His mother was Woizero ("Lady") Yeshimebet Ali Abba Jifar, daughter of a ruling chief from Worre 
         Ilu in Wollo province, Dejazmach Ali Abba Jifar. His maternal grandmother was of Gurage heritage. Tafari's
          father was Ras Makonnen Wolde Mikael, the grandson of King Sahle Selassie and governor of Harar. 
         Ras Makonnen served as a general in the First Italoâ€“Ethiopian War, playing a key role at the Battle
          of Adwa; Haile Selassie was thus able to ascend to the imperial throne through his paternal grandmother, 
        Woizero Tenagnework Sahle Selassie, who was an aunt of Emperor Menelik II and daughter of 
        the Solomonic Amhara King of Shewa, Negus Sahle Selassie. As such, Haile Selassie claimed direct 
        descent from Makeda, the Queen of Sheba, and King Solomon of ancient Israel.

    <h1> Governorship </h1>
    <p>
      Tafari assumed the titular governorship of Selale in 1906, a realm of marginal importance, but one that enabled him to continue his studies. In 1907, he was appointed governor over part of the province of Sidamo. It is alleged that during his late teens, Haile Selassie was married to Woizero Altayech, and that from this union, his daughter Princess Romanework was born.
    Following the death of his brother Yelma in 1907, the governorate of Harar was left vacant, and its administration was left to Menelik's loyal general, Dejazmach Balcha Safo. Balcha Safo's administration of Harar was ineffective, and so during the last illness of Menelik II, and the brief reign of Empress Taitu Bitul, Tafari was made governor of Harar in 1910 or 1911.
    On 3 August, he married Menen Asfaw of Ambassel, niece of the heir to the throne Lij Iyasu.

     <h1> Regency </h1>
    <p>
      The extent to which Tafari Makonnen contributed to the movement that would come to depose Lij Iyasu has been discussed extensively, particularly in Haile Selassie's own detailed account of the matter. Iyasu was the designated but uncrowned emperor of Ethiopia from 1913 to 1916. Iyasu's reputation for scandalous behavior and a disrespectful attitude towards the nobles at the court of his grandfather, Menelik II, damaged his reputation. Iyasu's flirtation with Islam was considered treasonous among the Ethiopian Orthodox Christian leadership of the empire. On 27 September 1916, Iyasu was deposed.
